How to use this in Brackets:

Open Brackets and click on little git icon on the right panel. Git icon is under the plugin icon (looks like a Lego cube).

Paste there this link: https://github.com/mildakozak/fitnessapp.git

Now you have cloned the repository.
You can make changes in the code and test them on you computer before pushing them to the repository to make sure that your code is working.

When your code is working:

You see all the changes you made in the git window.
Use the checkboxes to select all the changes you want to implement.

Now click on "Commit" and add a relevant description to describe what you're changing (to the commit message).
Click Git Push on the right side of the screen (little book with an arrow poining up).

Now you made a push and everybody else can see your changes.

Then click on "Fetch all" (little cloud icon) and after that click on "Git Pull" to update your folder so you can see our changes.
